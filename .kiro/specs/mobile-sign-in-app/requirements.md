# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a web-based sign-in application that employees can access through their mobile device browsers. The web app will capture employee location data, timestamps, and send this information via email to head office. The app will serve as a digital check-in system for field workers or remote employees, providing location verification and attendance tracking capabilities through any mobile browser.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a field employee, I want to sign in using my mobile device browser, so that I can record my attendance and location for work tracking purposes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user navigates to the web app URL THEN the system SHALL display a sign-in interface
2. WHEN the user taps the sign-in button THEN the system SHALL capture the current GPS location using browser geolocation API
3. WHEN the user signs in THEN the system SHALL record the current date and time
4. WHEN location services are disabled in the browser THEN the system SHALL prompt the user to enable location access
5. IF the user denies location permission THEN the system SHALL display an error message and prevent sign-in

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a head office manager, I want to receive sign-in data via email, so that I can track employee attendance and verify their work locations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user successfully signs in THEN the system SHALL automatically send an email to the configured head office address
2. WHEN sending the email THEN the system SHALL include the employee's location coordinates
3. WHEN sending the email THEN the system SHALL include the exact date and time of sign-in
4. WHEN sending the email THEN the system SHALL include the employee's identifier or name
5. IF the email fails to send THEN the system SHALL store the sign-in data locally and retry sending

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure email settings and head office contact information, so that sign-in data is sent to the correct recipients.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app is first installed THEN the system SHALL prompt for head office email configuration
2. WHEN configuring email settings THEN the system SHALL validate the email address format
3. WHEN email settings are saved THEN the system SHALL test the email connection
4. IF email configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages
5. WHEN email settings are updated THEN the system SHALL apply changes to future sign-ins

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a field employee, I want the web app to work on both iOS and Android mobile browsers, so that I can use my preferred mobile device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the web app is accessed on iOS Safari THEN the system SHALL function identically to Android browsers
2. WHEN the web app is accessed on Android Chrome THEN the system SHALL function identically to iOS browsers
3. WHEN requesting location permissions THEN the system SHALL use browser-standard geolocation permission prompts
4. WHEN accessing browser features THEN the system SHALL handle cross-browser compatibility correctly
5. WHEN displaying the interface THEN the system SHALL be responsive and mobile-optimized for all screen sizes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a field employee, I want my sign-in data to be secure and private, so that my location information is protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN location data is captured THEN the system SHALL encrypt the data before transmission
2. WHEN storing data locally THEN the system SHALL use secure storage mechanisms
3. WHEN sending emails THEN the system SHALL use secure email protocols (TLS/SSL)
4. WHEN the app is uninstalled THEN the system SHALL remove all locally stored sign-in data
5. IF network connection is insecure THEN the system SHALL warn the user before transmitting data
